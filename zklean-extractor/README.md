ZKLean Extractor
----------------

This program extracts a Lean4 representation of the Jolt frontend suitable for the [ZkLean](https://github.com/GaloisInc/zk-lean) library. This allows for formal reasoning in Lean about the correctness of the frontend. The R1CS constraints and instruction lookups are all taken automatically from the Jolt codebase, so any changes will be reflected in the Lean code.

Running
=======

This tool allows you to produce a package containing a ZkLean representation of the Jolt VM by running the following command from the root of the Jolt repo:
```sh
cargo run --release -p zklean-extractor -- -p $PATH_TO_MODULE
```
The other files in the module will be read from the template directory in `$PATH_TO_JOLT_REPO/zklean-extractor/package-template` when the tool is built. You can specify a different template directory at run time by running this, instead:
```sh
cargo run --release -p zklean-extractor -- -t $PATH_TO_TEMPLATE_DIR -p $PATH_TO_MODULE
```

Alternatively, you can produce a single source file in the ZkLean repo by running the following command from the root of the Jolt repo:
```sh
cargo run --release -p zklean-extractor -- -f $PATH_TO_ZKLEAN_REPO/src/ZkLean/SubtableMles.lean
```

Testing
=======

You can run tests on the internal representation produced by the `zklean-extractor` executable by running the following from the root of the Jolt repo:
```sh
cargo test -p zklean-extractor
```

This tests use the [`proptest`](https://docs.rs/proptest/latest/proptest/index.html) library to ensure that extracting a representation of each constraint and MLE and executing it produces the same result as computing the constraint or MLE on its own. By default we run proptest for 256 iterations, however this can be changed by running
```sh
PROPTEST_CASES=$DESIRED_NUMBER_OF_ITERS cargo test -p zklean-extractor
```
