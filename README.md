Just One Lookup Table.

Jolt is a zkVM (zero-knowledge virtual machine) for RISC-V, built to be the simplest, fastest, and most extensible general-purpose of its kind. This repository currently contains an implementation of Jolt for the RISC-V 32-bit Base Integer instruction set (RV32I). _Contributors are welcome!_

The Jolt [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1217.pdf) was written by Arasu Arun, Srinath Setty, and Justin Thaler.

## Quickstart

> [!NOTE]
> Jolt is in alpha and is not suitable for production use at this time.

For developers looking to build using Jolt, check out the [Quickstart guide](https://jolt.a16zcrypto.com/usage/quickstart.html).

For developers looking to contribute to Jolt, follow the instructions below.

## Installation

You will need Rust [nightly](./rust-toolchain.toml).

If you have `rustup` installed, you do not need to do anything as it will
automatically install the correct toolchain and any additional targets on the
first `cargo` invocation.


Clone this repo:

```git clone git@github.com:a16z/jolt.git```

To check if `rustup` has picked the right version of Rust run `rustup show`
inside the cloned repository.

```cd jolt; rustup show```.

## Build

This repository uses workspaces, and each workspace can be built individually, e.g.

```cargo build -p jolt-core```

For faster incremental builds, use the `build-fast` profile:

```cargo build --profile build-fast -p jolt-core```

## Test

Unit and end-to-end tests for `jolt-core` can be run using the following command:

```cargo test -p jolt-core```

Examples in the [`examples`](./examples/) directory can be run using e.g.

```cargo run --release -p sha2-chain```


## Performance profiling

Jolt uses [tracing_chrome](https://crates.io/crates/tracing-chrome) for performance profiling.

To generate a trace, run:

```cargo run --release -p jolt-core trace --name sha3 --format chrome --pcs hyper-kzg```

Where `--name` can be `sha2`, `sha3`, `sha2-chain`, or `fibonacci`. The corresponding guest programs can be found in the [`examples`](./examples/) directory. The benchmark inputs are provided in [`bench.rs`](./jolt-core/src/benches/bench.rs).

The above command will output a JSON file, e.g. `trace-1712455107389520.json`, which can be viewed in [Perfetto](https://ui.perfetto.dev/).
