[`bmmtv module`](./) was forked from the
[RIPP (Arkworks-rs)](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/ripp) implementation, which
is dual-licensed under the
[Apache](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/algebra/blob/master/LICENSE-APACHE) and
[MIT](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/algebra/blob/master/LICENSE-MIT) licenses.

This version of BMMTV removes all abstraction to be highly optimized for the
polynomial commitment. It also simplifies all trait bounds and was updated to
use our current KZG implementation.
