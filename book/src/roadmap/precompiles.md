# Precompiles

Precompiles are highly optimized SNARK gadgets which can be invoked from the high-level programming language of the VM user. These gadgets can be much more efficient for the prover than compiling down to the underlying ISA by exploiting the structure of the workload. In practice zkVMs use these for heavy cryptographic operations such as hash functions, signatures and other elliptic curve arithmetic.
