# Profiling

If you're an application developer, you may want to profile your guest program: fewer cycles = faster proof. If so, check out [Guest profiling](./guest_profiling.md).

If you're contributing to Jolt, you may be interested in profiling Jolt itself, in which case you should check out [zkVM profiling](./zkvm_profiling.md)
